How come you're always such a fussy young man?
Don't want no Captain Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran
Well, don't you know that other kids are starving in Japan?
So, eat it, just eat it
Don't wanna argue, I don't wanna debate
Don't wanna hear about what kind of food you hate
You won't get no dessert 'til you clean off your plate
So eat it, don't you tell me you're full
Just eat it (eat it), eat it (eat it)
Get yourself an egg and beat it
Have some more chicken, have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
Just eat it (eat it), just eat it (eat it)
Just eat it (eat it), just eat it (eat it), ooh
Your table manners are a cryin' shame
You're playin' with your food, this ain't some kind of game
Now if you starve to death, you'll just have yourself to blame
So eat it, just eat it
You better listen, better do what you're told (ooh)
You haven't even touched your tuna casserole (ooh!)
You better chow down or it's gonna get cold
So eat it, I don't care if you're full
Just eat it (eat it), eat it (eat it)
Open up your mouth and feed it
Have some more yogurt, have some more Spam
It doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned
Just eat it (eat it), eat it (eat it)
Don't you make me repeat it
Have a banana, have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Eat it (eat it), eat it (eat it)
If it's gettin' cold, reheat it
Have a big dinner, have a light snack
If you don't like it, you can't send it back
Just eat it (eat it, hee-hee), eat it (eat it)
Get yourself an egg and beat it (oh, Lord!)
Have some more chicken (hee-hee), have some more pie (hee-hee)
It doesn't matter if it's broiled or fried
Just eat it (eat it), eat it (eat it)
Don't you make me repeat it (oh, no)
Have a banana (hee-hee), have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch

As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know, I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the morning, I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows, fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores, and you finish thine
Then tonight, we're gonna party like it's 1699
We been spending most our lives
Livin' in an Amish paradise
I churned butter once or twice
Livin' in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Livin' in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Livin' in an Amish paradise
A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude?
You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree I really look good in black, fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired
There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Crusoe
It's as primitive as can be
We been spending most our lives
Livin' in an Amish paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Livin' in an Amish paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Livin' in an Amish paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice
Livin' in an Amish paradise
Hitchin' up the buggy, churnin' lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another
Think you're really righteous?
Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
On my knees day and night, scorin' points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie
We been spending most our lives
Livin' in an Amish paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Livin' in an Amish paradise
There's no cops or traffic lights
Livin' in an Amish paradise
But you'd probably think it bites
Livin' in an Amish paradise

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Look at the situation they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin', got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

They see me mowin'
My front lawn
I know they're all thinking
I'm so white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Can't you see I'm white 'n' nerdy?
Look at me I'm white 'n' nerdy
I wanna roll with
The gangsters
But so far they all think
I'm too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Really, really white 'n' nerdy
First in my class here at M.I.T.
Got skills, I'm a champion at DND
MC Escher, that's my favorite MC
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library
My Myspace page is all totally pimped out
I got people begging for my top 8 spaces
Yo, I know Pi out to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper, I can play for days
Once you see my sweet moves you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer rap I haven't run
At Pascal well I'm number 1
Do Vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun (what?)
Happy Days is my favorite theme song
I can sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in Java Script as well as Klingon
They see me roll on, my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm
White 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Can't you see I'm white 'n' nerdy?
Look at me I'm white 'n' nerdy
I'd like to roll with
The gangsters
Although it's apparent I'm too
White n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
How'd I get so white 'n' nerdy?
I've been browsing, inspectin'
X-Men comics you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me board
Shopping online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized the Holy Grail really well
I can recite it right now have you ROTFLOL
I got a business doing websites
When my friends need some code who do they call?
I do HTML for them all
Even make a homepage for my dog
Yo, I got myself a fanny pack
They were having a sale down at the GAP
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop pop!
Hope no one sees me get freaky!
I'm nerdy in the extreme
And whiter than sour cream
I was in AV club and Glee club
And even the chess team!
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
I spend every weekend at the Renaissance Faire
I got my name on my underwear!
They see me strollin'
They laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause
I'm so white 'n' nerdy
Just because I'm white 'n' nerdy
Just because I'm white 'n' nerdy
All because I'm white 'n' nerdy
Holy cow I'm white 'n' nerdy!
I wanna bowl with
The gangsters
But oh well it's obvious I'm
White 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Look at me I'm white 'n' nerdy!

[Chorus]
They're coming, I'm running out of food
No place to run, I'm in my own tomb
This is goodbye, the end of the line
They're coming, I'm running out of time

[Verse 1]
And I...I started so small
I was over my head, I had nothing at all
And I...I've built up my walls
With no reason to run, never thought I would fall

[Chorus]
They're coming, I'm running out of food
No place to run, I'm in my own tomb
This is goodbye, the end of the line
They're coming, I'm running out of time

[Verse 2]
And I...I wanted to fight
Left the ones that I loved
And said my goodbyes

[Chorus]
They're coming, I'm running out of food
No place to run, I'm in my own tomb
This is goodbye, the end of the line
They're coming, I'm running out of time

[Outro]
They're coming, I'm running out of time
They're coming...
